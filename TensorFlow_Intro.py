    TensorFlow(TF) is a software library extensively used in machine learning.
    TF uses a high-level API called `Keras` that provide a powerful, intuitive
    framework for building and training deep learning models. Learn:
        Basic of computations in TensorFlow
        Keras API
        TensorFlow imperative execution style: `Eager`
    
    Why is TensorFlow called TensorFlow ?
    
    TensorFlow is called 'TensorFlow' because it handles the flow (node/mathematical
    operation) of Tensors, which are data structures that you can think of as
    multi-dimensional arrays. Tensors are represented as n-dimensional arrays of
    base datatypes such as a string or integer -- they provide a way to generalize
    vectors and matrices to higher dimensions.
    
    The `shape` of a Tensor defines its number of dimensions and the size of each
    dimension. The `rank` of a Tensor provides the number of dimensions(n-dimensions)
    -- you can also think of this as the Tensor's order or degree.

### Computations on Tensors ###
# A convenient way to think about and visualize computations in TensorFlow is in
# terms of graphs. We can define this graph in terms of Tensors, which hold data
# , and the mathematical operations that act on these Tensors in some order.
#
# Each node in the graph represents an operation that takes some input, does some
# computation, and passes its output to another node.

# Create the nodes in the graph and initialize values
a = tf.constant(15)
b = tf.constant(61)

c1 = tf.add(a, b)
# TensorFlow overrides the "+" operation so that it is able to act on Tensors
c2 = a + b
print(c1)
print(c2)

# Construct a simple computation function
def func(a, b):
    "Define the operation for c, d, e (tf.add, tf.subtract, tf.multiply)"
    c = tf.add(a, b)
    d = tf.subtract(b, 1)
    e = tf.multiply(c, d)

# Neural networks in TensorFlow. We define neural networks in TensorFlow. TF uses
# a high-level API called `Keras` that provides powerful, intuitive framework
# for building and training deep learning models. Tensors can flow through abstract
# types called `Layer` - the building blocks of neural networks operations and
# are used to update weights, compute losses and define inter-layer connectivity.

# Define a network Layer

        # Define and initialize parameters: weight matrix W and bias b

# Conveniently, TensorFlow has defined a number of `Layers` that are commonly
# used in neural networks like `Dense`. Instead of using a single `Layer` to
# define simple neural network, use the `Sequential` model from Keras and a
# single `Dense` layer to define network. With `Sequential` API, create neural
# networks by stacking together layers like building blocks.

# In addition to defining models using the `Sequential` API, we can also define
# neural networks by directly subclassing the `Model` class, which groups layers
# together to enable model training and inference. The `Model` class captures
# what we refer to as a "model" or as a "network". Using Subclassing, we can
# create a class for our model and then define the forward pass through the
# network using the `call` function.

# loops, custom activation functions and custom models.

# How to actually implement network training with backpropagation
"""
    Automatic differentiation in TensorFlow
    Automatic differentiation is one of the most important parts of TensorFlow
    and is the backbone of training with backpropagation. Use TF GradientTape
    `tf.GradientTape` to trace operations for computing gradients.
    
    When a forward pass is made through the network, all forward-pass operations
    get recorded to a "tape"; then, to compute the gradient, the tape is played
    backwards. By default, the tape is discarded after it is played backwards;
    this means that a particular `tf.GradientTape` can only compute one gradient,
    and subsequent calls throw a runtime error.
    
    However, we can compute multiple gradients over the same computation by
    creating a `persistent` gradient tape.
